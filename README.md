# Diamond database analysis

This dashboard explores this diamonds transaction's database. It aims to find the biggest predictors of diamond's prices. 

### Process

The database was first turned into a convenient .csv in a jupyter notebook with SQLite and Python. (This can be found in the notebooks folder). 

Information was finally plotted in tableau. It analyses: 

The relation between depth and table   
The average price based on color, carat and cut   
Carat vs clarity   
Price vs color   
Price distribution   
Price based on carat and clarity
